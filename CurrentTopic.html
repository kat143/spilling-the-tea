            Hey everyone!
            <br>
            <br>
            We're Harika and Kaitlyn, and we're starting a blog to discuss issues of the world with everyone.
            <br>
            <br>
            So a quick brief of who we are and what we like:
            <br>
            <br>
            Kaitlyn’s been hooked onto computer science after her first computer science class back in freshman year of high school. Over the last three years, she’s experimented in the intersection of robotics and computer science, app development (both web-based and phone-based), artificial intelligence, competitive programming (she is currently USACO silver), and more; in fact, she is working on developing multiple websites (including this one!). Aside from CS, her other passion is writing. Kaitlyn is an avid reader and writer, mostly writing science fiction or fantasy short stories. She has big plans to write several novels in the future, though those are still in the works.

            Harika has loved aerospace ever since she was a kid. Now, in her senior year of high school, she's the President of the nonprofit Project Caelus, working to become the first high school team in the world to launch a liquid-fueled rocket. In an effort to build her network within the aerospace industry, she is Women in Aerospace's first high school volunteer and volunteered at several events, such as the 66th Robert H. Goddard Memorial Dinner. She also works with the AIAA and is often invited to present about aerospace to young girls to inspire them to enter engineering. In the future, Harika wants to start an aerospace startup and change the world of aviation. She loves discussing the future of the fields of aerospace, quantum, AI, and ethics in the business world.

            <br>
            Our first discussion topic is the future intersection of aerospace and AI, and what it means for humanity.
            <br>
            <br>
            Harika: So let's start with the past and present of aerospace. Where was the world and where is it now? The first plane took flight in 1903, with the Wright Brothers. In 2023, 120 years later, the progress that we've made since then is absurd. Not only in aviation but also in rocketry. The first liquid-fueled rocket was launched in 1926, by Robert H. Goddard. During World War 2, airplane technology made a jump in reliability and speed. Jet engines came next, as did the Cold War with the Space Race. Then we have commercialized aircraft, and as of right now, dreams of Mars exploration and commercial rocketry with Blue Origin and SpaceX. The fields of aeronautics and astronautics have changed significantly over the years, and the future has a lot in store for us in terms of potential.

            <br>
            Kaitlyn: Contrast that with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). It first arose in the mid-20th century as hardware improvements allowed computing to be cheaper and faster. Despite high hopes—some researchers at the time thought AI that had the same intelligence levels as that of a human could come into fruition within a decade or so—and initial enthusiasm, though, eventually those working on such projects realized that computers were nowhere near powerful enough to handle what they envisioned. Momentum fizzed out for a while, before then being revived again in the 1980s. Since then, through ups and downs, AI has taken generous strides from its simple beginnings. We have self-driving car algorithms, game machines that can beat the best of the best human players, and seemingly endless applications of AI within other fields like medicine, economics, and more. It hasn’t even been a full century since its start, yet very impressive progress has already been made.
            <br>
            <br>
            Harika: For the future of aerospace, my predictions lie mostly with SpaceX. For example, NASA has contracts with SpaceX to develop human landers for the Artemis mission. BlueOrigin used to be a big player, but they're ~4 years behind their projected timeline and have around 20 successful launches, whereas SpaceX has had over 200. They also got into a legal battle with NASA over NASA's favoritism of SpaceX in terms of grants. BlueOrigin, at this point, has all but dropped out of the game in aerospace advancement. But SpaceX is on the rise, and heading towards many of its goals to spread humans across the Solar System, and to make rockets as common as planes, so to speak. Commercialized aerospace has been gaining popularity regardless, with capitalism driving most progress in aerospace today. More and more aerospace majors are flocking over to SpaceX, where they'll be paid more, and be at the forefront of technology, as opposed to the lower-paying, complicated government bureaucracy of NASA. There is a small window here for other companies to begin development in aerospace and aviation, but it isn't a big one. For a new aerospace company to make waves, they need to not only be aiming for something else but also introduce an entirely new type of technology. Instead of aiming to put people on another planet, create self-sufficient habitats that can also fly, for example. But the important part of making that happen is bringing aerospace to the common person. Rocketry has stayed "rocket science" forever, and its potential is enormous. The complex engineering that goes into aerospace is useful in almost every other field of science, and science is known to be interconnected, to the point where studying one field can create breakthroughs in another. Getting aerospace and rocketry down to the common person makes it not only more accessible and exciting for kids to get into STEM in the first place but also accelerates humanity's development and lets us spread to other planets. With more space and more distance between people, I would expect some issues with countries having political instability, poverty, and huge wealth gaps to at least have the potential to be solved. The issue with all of these problems is infrastructure, and where there are new places to go, people can journey there and build a community for themselves. If they can't afford it, maybe there will eventually be a "fly on standby" option for rockets. The possibilities are endless.

            Kaitlyn: The future of AI is far more cloudy than for aerospace. For starters, due to its relative novelty, we just don’t know how fast development can happen—perhaps even overnight, someone could invent a groundbreaking new algorithm. A prominent area (and, for the matter, concern) has been AI and automation. There is no doubt that a machine controlled by some code performs repetitive, precise tasks better and possibly more efficiently than humans, but by employing machines, human workers are being let go. Those who could be affected by this switch are rightfully worried about their job security, but I just don’t see AI taking over all human jobs especially soon. In particular, no algorithm can replicate human creativity or emotion as well as actual people can, meaning jobs in those sectors are relatively secure. What I expect the goal of automation to be is to create things that work with people as opposed to replacing them. Plus, though AI seems to be getting stronger and more advanced, it still requires a lot of human hand-holding. Take self-driving cars, for instance. Yes, they can get you from Point A to Point B. However, constant vigilance by the passengers is definitely still needed as these algorithms just are not that advanced. Such vehicles might be perfect on slow-moving, spacious roads that are free of obstacles, but if you add in more nuanced elements that might appear on a trip (like road work, pedestrians, or even just places where the data for the environment is unavailable), then these self-driving wonders turn back into normal cars needing to be steered by a person. Human safety is yet to be placed fully in the hands of AI, though collaboration between the two is already prevalent. Autopilot systems on airplanes, for example, give pilots the option to hand over control of the aircraft to computer systems, yet pilots are still trained to fly an airplane just in case such computer systems fail. But because these systems are being constantly worked on and improved, perhaps there will come a day where transportation is added to the ever-growing list of industries AI has taken root in.
            <br>
            <br>
            Harika: That’s interesting. I think the progress of AI is also tied to how capitalism treats it. For instance, big companies created AI art to pay artists less, and AI voice technologies to again, pay workers less. People are often scared about AI “going rogue,” but I think a worse future would almost certainly be one in which AI, perfectly and lacking in compassion, follows the orders of its “capitalist overlords” to their end. In terms of aerospace, I think the impact is clear: taking humanity away from Earth and to other planets. If combined with artificial intelligence, we could have the possibility of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) becoming incredibly common for transport - maybe we'll have a system for commercial rocketry and transport to other planets. I would expect people who can afford it to buy property on other planets - hopefully, that is controlled properly so one rich family doesn't end up owning the entirety of Mars. Rather, the governments of the world could use this system to support larger populations. I'm worried about distribution though - the primary issue with poverty already is with wealth inequality - a lack of proper distribution structure and political instability in developing countries. With current political leaders, most of them being old, white men, already behind the times about AI and space exploration, I'm not certain that the correct infrastructure will be in place to control these new, emerging technologies. Our generation is now responsible for setting up this infrastructure that has the potential to possibly change the world. With relocation to other planets coming in the next couple of decades or so, an aerospace education will become invaluable, and for many, could become a way out of poverty. Learning to grow food on other planets is also essential. For AI, jobs in AI development, management, and policy will likely open up, and with more and more new jobs, the entire system will change to be based on technology. With proper planning, we could create a world where AI manages voting systems to stop corruption and strategically suggests the best possible moves for leaders to make to improve society. Humanity could become a multi-planet civilization that moves from world to world and is able to create countries of the traditionally disadvantaged on other planets that now have the power to define their own lives.

            Kaitlyn: But this change isn’t something we’ll see immediately. AI in aerospace right now manifests itself in forms of programs to help pilot aircrafts or during the manufacture of such vehicles. Commercial space flight is taking baby steps right now, and people have yet to walk on Mars, let alone start making technologies to support life on the planet. These are things that can change within this decade, and if done right, expansion to further locations in space could be attainable in the near future. But for AI alone, I don’t think that a sci-fi, dystopian world where smart robots function as the overlords of the world is something we’ll see when we wake up tomorrow. One of the more prominent tasks in the field is replicating a human brain with code; however, current computing capacities are likely not advanced enough to support the sheer amount of power such an undertaking would require. The idea is based upon the fact that researchers think the human brain can be broken down into an algorithm; the algorithm, as it stands today, is the neural network. Key features of the neural network (a machine learning process also referred to as “deep learning”) include connected nodes put in layers; this is mirroring how actual human brains work. Make a big enough network/other similar structure, and you might be able to code a human brain. If AI reaches this state, then maybe virtual “people” can work and live just as physical people do. They might have the ability to become sentient, generate new ideas, and do other things that are currently limited to humans. And this isn’t even the end: the AI could morph, either by human control or even by its own hand, into something more powerful than the human brain. If development reaches that point, it’s anyone’s gamble on how AI and humanity would interact; fundamentally, they might not share and thus work towards the same goals, meaning that conflict could be a possibility. However, all this is likely nothing that you or I would see in our lifetimes; realistically, progress in this sort of AI-copying-humans work will still be in its elementary forms.
