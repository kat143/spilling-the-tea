                Harika Akundi
            </h4>
            <p class="introduction">
                Harika had loved aerospace ever since she was a kid. Now, in her senior year of high school, she's the President of the nonprofit
                Project Caelus, working to become the first high school team in the world to launch a liquid-fueled rocket. In an effort to build
                her network within the aerospace industry, she is Women in Aerospace's first high school volunteer and volunteered at several
                events, such as the 66th Robert H. Goddard Memorial Dinner. She also works with the AIAA, and is invited often to present about
                aerospace to young girls to inspire them to go into the field of engineering. In the future, Harika wants to start an aerospace
                startup and change the world of aviation. She loves discussing the future of the fields of aerospace, quantum, AI, and ethics
                in the business world.

                Kaitlyn Lu
            </h4>
            <p class="introduction">
                Kaitlyn’s been hooked onto computer science after her first computer science class back in freshman year of high school. Over the
                last three years, she’s experimented in the intersection of robotics and computer science, app development (both web-based and
                phone-based), artificial intelligence, competitive programming (she is currently USACO silver), and more; in fact, she is working
                on developing multiple websites (including this one!). Aside from CS, her other passion is writing. Kaitlyn is an avid reader and
                writer, mostly writing science fiction or fantasy short stories. She has big plans to write several novels in the future, though
                those are still in the works.
