                Harika: So let's start with the past and present of aerospace. Where was the world and where is it now? The first plane took flight in 1903, with the Wright Brothers. In 2023, 120 years later, the progress that we've made since then is absurd. Not only in aviation but also in rocketry. The first liquid-fueled rocket was launched in 1926, by Robert H. Goddard. During World War 2, airplane technology made a jump in reliability and speed. Jet engines came next, as did the Cold War with the Space Race. Then we have commercialized aircraft, and as of right now, dreams of Mars exploration and commercial rocketry with Blue Origin and SpaceX.

                    We're Kaitlyn and Harika, two high school seniors at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.
                    Kaitlyn wants to study computer science in the future and Harika wants to study aerospace. We are both passionate
                    about discussing the future and its implications, and this blog will be a place to record our thoughts on what
                    the the world could look like as technology progresses.
